Card splitting with a GA

You have 10 cards numbered 1 to 10
You have to divide them into two piles so that:
The sum of the first pile is as close as possible to 36 (target sum).
And the product of all in the second pile is as close as possible to 360 (target prod).
Start State: 10 cards numbered 1 through 10

Goal State : 

Pile 0 : 5 cards (not always 5), some combination of cards such that they all add up (sum) to 36. 

Pile 1 : 5 cards (not always 5), some combination of cards such that they all multiply up (product) to 360, or as close as possible to 360. 

Generate a population of 30, so it is a 30 x 10 array. Randomly Initialize each individual to be a bit string, that is 0's and 1's depending on what pile the card belongs to. The column position of the array tells what card it is. 

Use combined error as the fitness function. 

loop though all genes for this individual of the population {

        if the gene value is 0, then put it in the sum (pile 0), and calculate sum
        (otherwise)if the gene value is 1, then put it in the product (pile 1), and calculate sum
}

sum_error = (calculated sum - target sum)/ target sum
prod_error = (calculated prod - target prod)/ target prod
combined error = abs(sum_error) + abs(prod_error)


If the combined error score is 0.0, then we have a good GA which has solved the 
problem domain.
